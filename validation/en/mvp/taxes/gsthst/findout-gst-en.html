        <h3>What will be your fiscal year for GST/HST purposes?</h3>
<p>Usually, your fiscal year for GST/HST purposes is the same as your tax year for income tax purposes. Generally, the tax year of the following persons is a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4022-general-information-gst-hst-registrants/general-information-gst-hst-registrants.html#D_103">calendar year</a>:</p>

<li>partnerships, where at least one member of the partnership is an individual, a professional corporation or another affected partnership</li>
</ul>
<p>However, some persons use non-calendar tax years. If you are a person described above that uses a non-calendar tax year approved by the CRA, you may want to use that same year as your GST/HST fiscal year.</p>
<p>A corporation generally uses the same fiscal year for both income tax purposes and GST/HST purposes. However, if a corporation has a non-calendar tax year for income tax purposes, it can elect to use a calendar year for its GST/HST fiscal year.</p>
<p>If you are a corporation that uses a non-calendar year for both income tax purposes and GST/HST purposes, and you change to another non-calendar tax year for income tax purposes, inform us of the change as soon as possible and we will change your GST/HST fiscal year to match it.</p>

<p>When you register for a GST/HST account, we assign you a reporting period. However, you may choose a more frequent reporting period. Your annual<strong> total </strong>revenue&nbsp;generally determines how many times a year you have to file GST/HST returns. </p>

        <h3>Does your business use accounting periods?</h3>
<p>Some businesses use accounting periods that are different from calendar months or quarters for tax reporting purposes.</p>
<p>If your business wants to use accounting periods instead of calendar months or quarters to file GST/HST returns, you need to get approval from us before the first day of each fiscal year to which the accounting periods relate. To do this, use our online services at <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a> or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/represent-a-client.html">Represent a Client</a>, or send us the completed <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst71-notification-accounting-periods-gst-hst.html">Form GST71, Notification of Accounting Periods for GST/HST</a>, or a written request before the beginning of each fiscal year.</p>
<p>Usually, your accounting periods have to meet the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each fiscal month has to be shorter than 36 days and, except for the first and the last month in a fiscal quarter, longer than 27 days. You can apply to have one fiscal month per quarter that is longer than 35 days. You can also apply to have fiscal months, other than the first or last month of the quarter, that are shorter than 28 days.</li>
<li>A fiscal quarter has to be shorter than 120 days and, except for the first and last fiscal quarters in the fiscal year, longer than 83 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not notify us of your accounting periods, we will assign calendar months and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4022-general-information-gst-hst-registrants/general-information-gst-hst-registrants.html#D_102">calendar quarters</a>, and you will have to wait until your next fiscal year to have the option to choose your accounting periods.</p>

<p id="details-panel4b">Although you have to register your business as a single entity, you can apply to have your branches or divisions file their own returns. You may want to keep track of your <strong>GST/HST</strong> accounts separately if your business has any of the following:</p>

<li>more than one location</li>
<li>more than one business activity (for example, gas station and pizza parlour)</li>
<li>offices in different provinces</li>
<li>divisions</li>
<li>different departments (for example, manufacturing and sales)</li>
</ul>
<p>To qualify to file separately, your branches or divisions have to be separately identified either by their location or the nature of their activities. They must also keep separate records. The branches and divisions have to keep the same reporting periods as the parent company.</p>

        <h4>Application to deem one unincorporated organization to be a branch of another unincorporated organization (GST32)</h4>
<p>Generally, when one unincorporated organization (such as a club or association) is a member of an unincorporated main organization, but is a separate entity, the organizations have to charge the GST/HST on taxable transactions between them, if they are GST/HST registrants. However, such organizations can apply jointly to have the member organization considered a branch of the main organization.</p>
<p>You can apply for authorization using <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst32.html">Form GST32, Application to Deem One Unincorporated Organization to be a Branch of Another Unincorporated Organization</a>. If the application is approved, the GST/HST will not apply to transfers of goods and services between the member organization and the main organization.</p>
